# Key differences between the June and December data
The June average temperature is 75F with the highest recorded at 85F and the lowest at 64F. The standard deviation of 3.25 indicates that the June temperature data points do not vary much, and 50% of the data falls within 73F to 77F.

# Recommendations for further analysis

1. The temperature data should be filtered by the altitudes of the stations. Only the stations that are close to the sea level would provide the temperature data relevant to our Surfs Up venture. After all, we won't be setting up a Surf & Ice Cream shop on top of the Hawaiian mountains!
2. The precipitation scores should be filtered by the quadrants of the stations and limited to the West Coast and the North Shore of Oahu. Oahu is known to have microclimates and generally drier on the West Coast and the North Shore while wetter and greener on the East Coast. Only the stations that are close to the surfing area would be relevant to our analysis.
3. Due to climate change, it might make more sense to limit the temperature data to past 5 years and calculate the monthly average to demonstrate true seasonality (or lack thereof) of the island.
